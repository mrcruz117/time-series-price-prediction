    "# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is downloaded from the Kaggle [Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Train.csv` is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* `Valid.csv` is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012.\n",
    "* `Test.csv` is the test set, which contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the **RMSLE (root mean squared log error)** between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.\n",
